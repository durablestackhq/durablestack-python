## External Payload Contract Policy

- Field names and value semantics align with current platform-facing .NET payloads.
- Validators are strict for required fields and permissive for nullable optional fields.
- Breaking payload changes require coordinated runtime + platform versioning.

## Schema and Runtime Boundaries

- Runtime schemas are runtime-specific by design.
- Python and .NET runtimes may share a DB instance but must use separate tables/prefixes.
- Startup must verify that existing tables at the configured prefix match Python runtime schema expectations.
